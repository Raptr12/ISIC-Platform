      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>At Here We Grow, Early Childhood Learning, we believe each child is a unique gift. Our staff provides the utmost quality of care by retaining a safe, clean, healthy and loving environment in which each child can grow and learn. We maintain a high level of sensitivity to the social, emotional, intellectual, physical, and creative needs each child has so that we may tailor our program to fit each child’s necessities. Our goal is to encourage each child to develop a positive self-image and develop a sense of pride and accomplishment throughout their exploration of growing and learning.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>Here We Grow, Early Childhood Learning, is a family owned and operated childcare center.Our center is licensed to care for children between 6 weeks and 6 years. At Here We Grow we value a nutritious homemade diet as well as an enriched, educationally based curriculum. We feel as though learning doesn't just occur in the classroom but through hands on experiences as well. A great example of this can be seen in our garden, in the summer, as the children assist their teachers in caring for the garden. Furthermore, we believe that keeping the lines of communication open and smooth flowing are crucial in developing happy and healthy relationships with our families. Our doors are always open and we encourage parents to be as involved as they like!</p>
